description: Kana (仮名) refer to syllabaries used to write Japanese phonological units.
---

The term kana (仮名) may refer to a number of syllabaries used to write Japanese phonological units, morae.

Usually, hiragana is the default syllabary, and katakana is used in certain special cases.

A Gojūon (五十音, "fifty sounds") is a traditional system ordering kana characters by their component phonemes.

Mnemonics to remember the order of each line of kana: **A**h, **K**ana **S**ymbols, **T**ake **N**ote **H**ow **M**any **Y**ou **R**ead **W**ell.

## Hiragana

Hiragana is used to write native Japanese words with no kanji representation.
