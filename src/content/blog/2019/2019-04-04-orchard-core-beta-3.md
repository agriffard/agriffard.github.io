Orchard Core is available in [Beta 3](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta3).

## Open-source, modular, multi-tenant application framework and CMS for ASP.NET Core

### Flexible content management

Define custom content types dynamically and reuse content fields. Define roles and permissions for all your users.

### Full, decoupled, or headless cms

You can separate the content management from the front-end by using GraphQL, and create SPA applications or even static websites.

### Modular

Every feature is a module which ships as a Nuget package, can be enabled, disabled or replaced. Create your own ecosystem of modules, or reuse existing ones to bootstrap your applications.

### Multi-tenant

A single installation lets you manage multiple sites. The notion of Recipe lets you write reusable websites templates.

### Speed

Between the fast performance of ASP.NET Core and the architectural choices of Orchard Core CMS, you get one of the fastest CMS solutions you have ever tried, on any OS (Windows, Linux, MacOS).

### Workflows

Create content validation workflows, and define Web Hooks to trigger external processes or react to external events
