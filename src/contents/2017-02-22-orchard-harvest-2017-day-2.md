This Wednesday February 22nd was the second day of the [Orchard Harvest conference](http://orchardharvest.org/) 2017 in New York.

We attended to many interesting sessions about Orchard Core and .NET Core.

## [Theming in Orchard Core](http://orchardharvest.org/sessions/building-themes-using-the-latest-client-side-technologies)

### Steve Taylor (Avastec)

Steve walked through how to create a theme in Orchard Core. He took an existing Wordpress theme and converted it to Orchard.

He also demonstrated how to build client side assets using the existing tooling and how this tooling can be extended to accommodate more advanced scenarios.

### Daniel Stolt (IDeliverable)

In this session, Daniel demonstrated techniques, tips and tricks for building client-side apps and components for use in Orchard websites.

He also described some ways to make your client-side apps available as content in Orchard for editors and site admins to use, how to make content and configuration from Orchard available in your apps client-side, and how to make Orchard's server-side routing and client-side routing play nice together.

## [Orchard Core CMS](http://orchardharvest.org/sessions/building-modules-for-orchard-core-cms)

Sébastien described the goals and the major changes of Orchard Core and made a demo about the main features already available in Ochard Core CMS as Setup, Content publishing, Lists, Fields, Live Preview, Layers, Menus, Flow, Widgets, Recipes, ....

The most important feature of Orchard Core is Performance.

Making a quick stress test, Orchard Core is able to return 2,000 requests per second, without caching enabled.

The memory usage and the number of tenants you can load will also be improved (500 tenants => 2Gb).
